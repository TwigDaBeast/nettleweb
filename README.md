NettleWeb (formerly WhiteSpider) is a free, open-source unblocked gaming platform designed for school or office users who are restricted from certain websites. It has now included more than 2500 HTML5, Flash, DOS and classic games, with additional **unblockers**, **emulators**, **unblocked YouTube** and **unblocked ChatGPT**.

NettleWeb is, and will always be, free and open-source. You can however show us your care by clicking on the **star** button at the top right corner. It would have a significant effect on this project's future development. <br />

## Mirror Links
Mirror links have been removed from this section, because they could easily get blocked once listed. Please consider using data URL for bypassing browser extensions, or self-host a mirror link for bypassing external network restrictions. (See below for instructions)

## Self Hosting
If the main link is not working properly, you could self-host your own mirror link by following the instructions below.

Note: If you see a 'disconnected' message showing in the header of your self-hosted mirror website, it means that the default backend server has been restricted. Games would still be able to play as normal, but you would not be able to access certain features such as unblocker. In this case, using a backend mirror might help. For detailed instructions, please join our Discord server by following the link above.

#### GitHub Pages
1. Click on the fork button at the top right corner to fork this repository.
2. Rename it to `username.github.io` where `username` is your actual GitHub username.
3. Open your forked repository, then go to settings->pages. Select branch 'Main' and click save.

Note: Due to resource linkage, hosting the website at non-root locations like `username.github.io/project` is **not supported** at this moment.

## Data URL
The code below is a data URL of an embedded NettleWeb mirror, it can bypass most restrictions set by browser extensions on Chrome and Edge. However it **cannot** be used to bypass external network restriction.
```
